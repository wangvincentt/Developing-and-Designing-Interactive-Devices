This weekâ€™s lab will have the following components: an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi, and a web camera.

1.  Bottom up ideation
Write down 10 things you think you can do with an Arduino, Raspberry Pi and web camera together. Write down 10 ideas on a piece of paper.

2. Top down ideation
If you could make any IoT thing, what would you build? Write down 10 ideas on another piece of paper.

3. Narrowing down
From those 20, pick 5 to detail: what do you imagine the parts of those to be? What services or capabilities would be required? Create a system diagram, dedicate one piece of paper to each concept. If you are unsure about  this or that other part of your diagram, a black box and list questions about what is in the box under the box.
4. Post all the idea sketches in your channel and cross post it to this assignment channel.
